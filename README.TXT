Assignment II
Your task is to develop a Java program to manage student marks. This is an extension from the first assignment. Your work must demonstrate your learning over the first five modules of this unit. The program will have the following functional requirements:
• F1: Read the unit name and students’ marks from a given text file. The file contains the unit name and the list of students with their names, student ids and marks for three assignments. The file also contains lines, which are comments and your program should check to ignore them when reading the students’ marks.
• F2: Calculate the total mark for each student from the assessment marks and print out the list of students with their name, student id, assessment marks and the total mark.
• F3: Print the list of students with the total marks less than a certain threshold. The threshold will be entered from keyboard.
• F4: Print the top 10 students with the highest total marks and top 10 students with the lowest total marks (algorithm 1).
• F5: Create a simple menu system to allow users to select and execute each function (algorithm 2).
